  Description
</h2>

I was just a simple front end software engineer but then i hit 3 years of experience. Knowing so much about buisiness and how the things can go pretty bad when the market has a lot of people learning the same thing, i dicided to study data science and persue my old passion for mathmatical field, even do i suck at it.


You know what they say, do it but do it with love.
